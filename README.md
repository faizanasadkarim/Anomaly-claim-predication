# Medicare Fraud Detection and Analysis
This project focuses on analyzing Medicare data to detect anomalies, identify potential fraud, and optimize healthcare reimbursement processes. By leveraging data analysis, machine learning, and visualization tools, the objective is to uncover unusual patterns in patient procedures, provider claims, and regional healthcare activities.

## üìù Overview
The project involves several key components:

Data Analysis: Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset and identify anomalies.

Database Creation: Setting up a SQL Server database to store and manage the data efficiently.

Visualization: Creating dynamic dashboards in Power BI to visualize key performance indicators (KPIs) and trends.

Machine Learning: Developing predictive models to forecast potential fraudulent activities.

Reporting: Compiling findings into a comprehensive presentation with insights and recommendations.

## üöÄ Key Contributions
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming raw data into a structured format suitable for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identifying patterns, trends, and anomalies within the data.

Dashboard Development: Designing interactive dashboards to monitor and analyze healthcare metrics.

Predictive Modeling: Applying machine learning algorithms to predict potential fraud cases.

Reporting and Documentation: Documenting methodologies, findings, and recommendations in a detailed report.
